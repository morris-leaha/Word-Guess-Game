# Word-Guess-Game
This is a take on the classic hang-man style game featuring December holiday words!

## How to Play

#### Open the Game
* Click the link at the top of the page to deploy and get playing right away!  

#### Instructions
* Press any letter key on your keyboard to start -- **NOTE**: The first letter pressed will be your first guess!
* You start with a total of 10 letter guesses.
* Each letter guess, whether correct or incorrect, will decrease your number of letter guesses remaining.
    * Rest easy, because you will not be able to "accidentally" guess the same letter twice!
* In order to *win*: 
    * You must guess the whole word correctly (fill in all the blanks) before you exhaust all of your guesses remaining.
    
## How the Game Works
* This game was built utilizing HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
* The computer loads a new randomly selected word from an list of words stored in an array, each time the page is loaded.
* Player input is received via key presses only.

## Things I'd Like to Still Add
* Resetting the game automatically after a user has either won or lost, with continuous tracking of wins and losses.
    * Would like the game to automatically reset after, but adding a button or other functionality might be tackled first.
* Rewarding the player if they win, before resetting the game with either:
    * A sound effect
    * An alert
    * An image of the word 
* If user loses, before resetting the game, I'd like to eventually:
    * Display the correct word
    * Display an image of the word
    * Sound a different sound
